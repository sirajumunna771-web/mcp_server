I can guide you through the process of signing up on the OpenWeather website and getting a free API key, but I cannot directly sign in or generate an API key for you. Here’s how you can do it yourself:
Steps to Get a Free API Key from OpenWeather


Go to the OpenWeather Website
Visit https://openweathermap.org/.


Sign Up

Click on the "Sign Up" button (usually at the top right corner).
Fill in your details (email, password, etc.) and complete the registration process.



Log In

After signing up, log in to your account.



Access the API Keys Section

Once logged in, go to the "API Keys" tab in your account dashboard.



Generate a Free API Key

You will see a default API key generated for you. If not, there should be an option to create a new key.
Copy this API key and keep it secure.



Use the API Key

You can now use this key to make API calls to OpenWeather’s services.



If you encounter any issues or need further clarification, let me know! I can also help you understand how to use the API key once you have it.
